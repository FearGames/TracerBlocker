        This hides any players that you can't physically see.
        There is a configurable ignore distance to negate the impact this feature has on legitimate players.

        This hides any chests you can't physically see.

    FakePlayers: (These players are invisible. They tracers I am using simply made them visible)

        These fake players don't come within 16 blocks from a real player, and thus won't be problematic during legit PVP.
        I recommend using this feature as little as possible. It's quite CPU intensive. Only enable this in worlds/servers with a small amount of players, and only if it's truly needed. Using it for a large amount of players might affect the server's TPS.
        It might also affect a user's FPS. I recommend increasing the "every-ticks" value to something like 40-60 if people are experiencing FPS drops.
        Those players have random sword and armor
